🧮 Factorial Calculator

This project allows users to calculate the factorial of an integer between 0 and 10. The user enters a number into the form, and the application displays the corresponding factorial.

🛠 Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS (with custom properties and Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic implementation)
- Google Fonts (Open Sans)

📁 Project Structure:

- `index.html`: Contains the main structure of the page with a form to input an integer.
- `css/style.css`: Defines the page styling, layout, and responsive behavior.
- `js/main.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic to:
  - Validate input values (must be an integer between 0 and 10).
  - Calculate the factorial using a for loop.
  - Display the result on the page.

⚡ Features:

- Accepts only valid integer inputs from 0 to 10.
- Displays an alert for invalid input.
- Calculates the factorial using iterative logic.
- Dynamically shows the result directly on the webpage.
- Responsive design and clean user interface with CSS customization.

🚀 How to Run:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enter a number between 0 and 10 and click "Enviar" to calculate the factorial.

Perfect for learning about input validation, DOM manipulation, and basic algorithm implementation with JavaScript.
